# COMP 250 Assignment 2 Tester

## A collaborative test suite for COMP 250's second assignment

## Disclaimers

- Please only add TEST CODE here, not actual assignment code. If you accidentally pushed your assignment code, please delete ASAP to avoid any inconveniences.
- You will need to add a toString() method in the Deck class that prints all the cards separated by spaces in order for some of the tests to pass.
- Otherwise, happy coding and debugging!

## How To Use

- You may clone this repo to your Intellij or your preferred IDE. If you aren't familiar with Git, our amazing TA Sasha made a tutorial https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFvevpoGcNCvjyTjOfPhzqjgb-L_WdX8r
- Worst case scenario, you may also copy paste the code onto a .java file under assignment1. It's not recommended since you might miss something, but it's quicker than the last method.
- You may also add new tests and create pull requests.
- Happy coding and debugging!

## Installing

For IntelliJ IDEA

VCS -> Get from Version Control... -> Paste the URL of this repository

For Eclipse

File -> Import -> Git -> Projects from Git (With Smart Import) -> Clone URI -> paste URL of this repository into the URI box -> Click next a bunch, setting directory at your own discression, Master branch from origin. All else default -> Finish

For both:

Drag your .java files from the assignment into the tester package.

In case your IDE does not automatically set package name, change your package name to COMP250A1_W2020

Regularly update the tester (pull the repository). Your assignment files will be ignored.
